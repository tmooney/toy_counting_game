# Toy Counting Game

A Clojure library designed to help me learn Clojure...
and that's about it!

But you can a play a game if you like.

## Try it out?

I've been using leiningen at everyone's recommendation, so...
```
brew install leiningen
```
or however you'd like to get it, then...

```
cd toy_counting_game
lein run 21 3 1
```
or just `lein run` to see what those numbers mean!
